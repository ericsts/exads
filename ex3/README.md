# 3. TV Series

Populate a MySQL (InnoDB) database with data from at least 3 TV Series using the following structure:
tv_series -> (id, title, channel, gender);
tv_series_intervals -> (id_tv_series, week_day, show_time);

* Provide the SQL scripts that create and populate the DB;
Using OOP, write a code that tells when the next TV Series will air based on the current time-date or an
inputted time-date, and that can be optionally filtered by TV Series title.
