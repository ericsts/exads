# 4. A/B Testing

Exads would like to A/B test some promotional designs to see which provides the best conversion rate.

Write a snippet of PHP code that redirects end users to the different designs based on the data provided by this library:

packagist.org/exads/ab-test-data

The data will be structured as follows:

“promotion” => [
  “id” => 1,
  “name” => “main”,
  “designs” => [
    [ “designId” => 1, “designName” => “Design 1”, “splitPercent” => 50 ],
    [ “designId” => 2, “designName” => “Design 2”, “splitPercent” => 25 ],
    [ “designId” => 3, “designName” => “Design 3”, “splitPercent” => 25 ],
  ]
]

The code needs to be object-oriented and scalable. The number of designs per promotion may vary.
